glowjs
------

glow.js is a repackaging of David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood's
[Glowscript](https://github.com/BruceSherwood/glowscript)
libraries as a single javascript file that is easy to include.

(This project is a placeholder.  It concatentates the files,
but it doesn't yet work.)

The build depends on node.js, grunt, and bower.
